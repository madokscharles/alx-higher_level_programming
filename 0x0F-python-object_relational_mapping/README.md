# Python Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)
- Python - OOP - SQL - MySQL - ORM - SQLAlchemy

## Description

This project provides a deeper understanding of object-relational mapping (ORM) framework for Python, shows how it allows developers to interact with databases using object-oriented programming principles. It simplifies the process of storing, retrieving, and manipulating data in a database without having to write raw SQL queries.

## Features

- Mapping Python classes to database tables.
- Automatic creation and management of database schemas.
- CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on database records using Python objects.
- Relationships between database tables (e.g., one-to-many, many-to-many).
- Support for various database backends (MySQL).

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
2. Install MySQLdb module version 2.0.x
3. Install SQLAlchemy module version 1.4.x
4. Clone this repository: `git clone <https://github.com/madokscharles/alx-higher_level_programming.git>`
3. Navigate to the project directory: `cd 0x0F-python-object_relational_mapping`

## Usage

1. Import the ORM library into your Python project.
2. Define your Python classes representing database tables, along with their attributes and relationships.
3. Establish a connection to the database using the provided configuration options.
4. Use the ORM methods to create, read, update, and delete records.
5. Perform queries and filter data.
6. Handle any exceptions or errors that may arise during database operations.
